// Tiles come in different forms:
// Solid tiles can not be entered, Open tiles are regular tiles with a flat floor and a flat ceiling.
// DiagonalOpen tiles are those with flat floors and ceilings, and two walls cut off by one diagonal wall.
// Slope tiles have a sloped floor (or ceiling). Valley tiles have one floor vertex lower while Ridge tiles have one
// floor vertex higher than the other three.
