This is a client application as part of the [InkyBlackness](https://inkyblackness.github.io) project, written in [Go](http://golang.org/). This application represents the browser-client part of Shocked.

**Note:** This client is very simplistic and more of a proof-of-concept of the Shocked-Server in its current state.
